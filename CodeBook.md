# Introduction

The summarised dataset represents the averaged values of the following features for each person and activity combination in the training and test datasets.

When selecting the features, only the average (mean) and standard deviation variables were used (all others were excluded).

See the section below for information on the features from the original data. Note that information that is not relevant has been omitted.

Columns have been named in the following way: [feature].[mean|std][.X|Y|Z] where '**feature**' is one of the features below, '**mean|std**' indicates whether the measure is the mean or standard deviation and '**.X|Y|Z**' indicates whether it is an axial signal in the X, Y or Z direction. Note that not all columns have direction (see features section below).

# Feature Selection 

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3.axial raw signals tAcc.XYZ and tGyro.XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc.XYZ and tGravityAcc.XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk.XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk.XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three.dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc.XYZ, fBodyAccJerk.XYZ, fBodyGyro.XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'.XYZ' is used to denote 3.axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
